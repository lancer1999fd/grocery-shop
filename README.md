# Groceries-List

## In a Nutshell
Groceries-List enables simple and efficient management of your shopping entries. With a user-friendly interface and intuitive features, users can easily create, organize, and check off their grocery lists. The app offers a clear structure, making it easy to keep track of all the items you need.

## Technology
### Django
"Groceries-List" was developed using the Django technology. Django is a popular web framework that is widely used for building high-quality web applications quickly and efficiently. It provides a powerful and secure infrastructure for developing complex applications, and it is known for its scalability and flexibility. With Django, developers can easily create web applications with clean and maintainable code, making it a popular choice for building web applications. The use of Django in the development of "Groceries-List" ensures that the app is reliable, secure, and easy to maintain.

### Black
Black is an automated code formatter for Python that aims to improve code quality and consistency in Python projects. With its straightforward and immutable formatting, Black ensures that code style is consistent within a project, increasing code readability and maintainability. Using Black in a project like Groceries-List helps keep the Python code clean and consistent, which contributes to development efficiency in the long term.

### isort
isort is a Python utility used to sort and clean the import statements in files. It automates the tedious and often error-prone manual organization of imports, making the code clearer and easier to understand. Integrating isort into the Groceries-List development process ensures that all Python files have a consistent import structure, promoting code quality and team collaboration.

### flake8
flake8 is a powerful linting tool for Python that identifies programming errors, style errors, and suspicious constructs. It helps developers adapt their code to the PEP 8 style guidelines, thereby promoting adherence to best practices in Python development. The use of flake8 in the "Groceries-List" project helps developers write clean and error-free code that is easy to maintain and update.

### Pillow
Pillow is a modern and powerful image editing library in Python. It extends the functionality of the outdated PIL library (Python Imaging Library) and offers a wide range of tools for editing and manipulating images. Using Pillow in "Groceries-List" allows image editing functions to be easily integrated into the app, be it for uploading user images, creating thumbnails, or other image-related functions.

### djlint
djlint is a tool for analyzing and cleaning HTML and template code, specifically for use with Django templates. It helps find and fix errors and inconsistencies in template files and helps improve the quality and readability of template code. Integrating djlint into the development of "Groceries-List" ensures that the templates are clean, error-free and easily maintainable, which forms a solid foundation for the application's user interface.

## Installation for developers
### MacOS
#### Clone Project
##### Using SSH
1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Generate an SSH key by typing the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and following the prompts.
3. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the project you want to clone.
4. Click on the "Clone or download" button and select "Use SSH" in the top right corner of the pop-up.
5. Copy the SSH URL provided.
6. In the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
7. Type the command `git clone git@github.com:buechijonas/project.groceries-list.git` and press Enter.
8. Wait for the project to be cloned.

#### Using HTTPS
1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the project you want to clone.
3. Click on the "Clone or download" button and select "Use HTTPS" in the top right corner of the pop-up.
4. Copy the HTTPS URL provided.
5. In the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
6. Type the command `git clone https://github.com/buechijonas/project.groceries-list.git` and press Enter.
7. Wait for the project to be cloned.

#### Pyenv
1. Install Pyenv via Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal: `brew install pyenv`
2. Once Pyenv is installed, you can install the desired version of Python. For Django 4.1.7, we recommend using Python 3.11.2 To install this version, run the following command: `pyenv install 3.11.2`.
((Warning: It's global, not in a virtual environment. Not recommend).)
3. To install virtualenv, you can use the following command if you are using macOS and Homebrew: `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`.  This will install pyenv-virtualenv, which is a plugin for pyenv that provides support for creating and managing virtual environment.
4. Once Python is installed, you can create a new virtual environment based on Python 3.11.2. To do this, run the following command in the project: `pyenv virtualenv 3.11.2 venv`.
5. Now navigate to your Django project directory and activate the newly created virtual environment. To do this, run the following commands: `cd (Your Path)/django/project` and `source (your path)/django/project/venv/bin/activte`. This will activate your existing virtual environment.

#### Django
1. Make sure you have Pyenv installed with the previous guide. If not, please follow the previous guide on how to install Pyenv.
2. Activate your virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal: `source (your path)/django/project/venv/bin/activate`. This will acitvate your virtual environment and any packages you install will be specific to this environment.
3. Once your virtual environment is activated, you can use pip to install packages. For example, to install Django, run the following command: `pip install django`. This will install the latest version of Django.
4. Wait for the installation to complete. The installation process should automatically install all necessary dependencies.
5. Check that Django was installed correctly by typing the command `django-admin --version` in the command prompt or terminal. If Django was installed, the current version of Django should be displayed.
6. You can also install packages from a `requirements.txt` file. This is useful when you need to install multiple packages at once. To install the packages listed a `requirements.txt` file, run he following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Note that it's important to do this while your virtual environment is activated. Installing packages globally can cause conflicts and make it difficult to manage dependencies.
   
Congratulations! You have successfully installed Django on your computer in a virtual environment.

#### Run project
1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the cloned project is located using the "cd" command.
3. Once you are in the project's directory, you should see a file called "manage.py". This file is responsible for managing the Django project.
4. Type the command `python manage.py runserver` and press Enter.
5. Wait for the server to start up.
6. Once the server is up and running, open your web browser and type "http://localhost:8000" in the address bar.
7. If everything was set up correctly, you should see the project.

#### Test project
1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the Django project's root directory.
2. Run the following command to execute all the tests in the project: `python manage.py test -p '*.py'`. This will run all the tests in the project, including any tests you've written yourself.
3. If you want to run tests for a specific app in your project, you can specify the app's name after the "test" command, like this: `python manage.py test <app_name>`. For example, if you want to run tests for the "feeds" app, you would use the following command: `python manage.py test feeds`.
4. Django provides a range of test runner option that you can use to customize your test execution, such as verbosity level and coverage report. To see all available options, run the following command: `python manage.py help test`.
